# Focus

Focus is a pomodoro timer that I created to strengthen a variety of skills. I started it to become more comfortable with HTML, CSS, and Javascript but it quickly grew into something more. I features a to do list to keep track of tasks, as well of a variety of vintage games to play during the breaks. 

Hope you enjoy!
